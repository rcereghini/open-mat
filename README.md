# Gatsby Starter Redux Firebase

Based on [gatsby-starter-firebase](https://github.com/muhajirframe/gatsby-starter-firebase/)

## What's included

- `FetchingExample` on how to fetch data from firebase.

  Note: For better experiece you might want to integrate it [redux](https://redux.js.org) or [mobx](http://mobx.js.org).

  If you need it, submit an issue. I can create a starter / example repo with firebase + mobx or redux.

- Authentication with [react-firebaseui](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web-react) (`SignIn`, `SignOut`)

- Example Todo with [react-redux-firebase](https://github.com/prescottprue/react-redux-firebase)
